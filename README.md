# 🎧 CryptoRemix – Procedural Audio NFTs with Stylus

**CryptoRemix** is a small creative experiment: what if you could turn a number into a sound… and that sound into an NFT?

Using Arbitrum Stylus and Rust, we generate a short audio clip entirely on-chain — no samples, no uploads. Just pure math and waves.

## 🧠 How it works

1. The user sends a `seed` (a number) to a smart contract written in Rust with Stylus.
2. The contract generates a **2-second audio waveform** procedurally (sine, square, or sawtooth).
3. Instead of sending back the full audio (too large for the blockchain), the contract computes a **hash** of the sound and returns that.
4. Off-chain, we recreate the same audio using the same seed.
5. We check if the sound meets some simple rules (like pitch or energy).
6. If it passes, we upload the `.wav` to IPFS and mint it as an NFT.

## ✨ Why Stylus?

Stylus lets us do things Solidity can't — like generate thousands of audio samples on-chain, fast and cheap. With Rust, we get powerful math, fine control over wave generation, and full EVM compatibility.

## 🔧 Tech stack

- 🦀 **Rust + Stylus SDK** – on-chain sound generation
- 🎛️ **Web Audio + JS** – waveform recreation & validation
- ☁️ **IPFS (via web3.storage)** – audio file storage
- 🧾 **ERC-721** – NFT minting linked to the generated audio

## 🎯 What's the point?

CryptoRemix explores how on-chain computation can create art — tiny, unique audio NFTs generated by code, verified on-chain, and minted only if they sound right.

No uploads. No samples. Just numbers → sound → NFT.
